# Indexed Catalog
An **indexed access point** based on a **smart search toolbar** that displays results as cards.<br>
Cards shows details about results, and can links to other pages or platforms.<br>

## Use case : BI Catalog
Plugged on top of **multiple BI platforms** (ex: Qlik Sense, IBM Cognos), users can search for a specific Report, Dashboard, Measure, Dimension, Source, Data Warehouse Table, Operational Source over all the BI platforms.<br>
A list of cards is displayed as search results, and users can quickly see **what's inside a BI object** before opening it in the corresponding platform.<br>
Users can also display the **lineage** in a  **dependency graph** from the Operational Source, through the DWH tables, until the BI applications and visualizations.

## Which challenges does it address?

**Business Users**
 - Get a simple Smart Search over any content that we can load in a Qlik Sense application
 - In BI context: Business Users donâ€˜t have an overview over the content available within their entire BI environment and the given functionality

**BICC/IT**
 - Offer a Smart Search interface that relies on the power of Qlik in back-end, without having to set a dedicated database environment
 - In BI context: BICC is often contacted by Business Users to guide them to existing apps, or by IT to get the usage of a source
